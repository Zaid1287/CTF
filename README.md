this is how the directory will look on a look up 
these are empty directories that are setup for the player to explore and to send them on a wild goose chase
Upon inspecting the hidden files on the root this is what is seen

there is a hidden directory with a special name that is not directly cd-able
after entering the directory there will be a text file that is a decoy just to waste time 
the file they will be looking for is an image with an encryted name (remember this)
the flag they will be searching for will be hidden in the metadata of the image
there are a few red herrigs setup to throw the player off
the actual flag has a double encryption that the player has to figure out


Congratulations!!! you have solved the CTF
